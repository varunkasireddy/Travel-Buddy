##  Project Vision

TravelBuddy makes travel planning effortless by combining machine learning with real-time data from multiple APIs. Simply tell us your budget, preferences, and departure city—we'll analyze 250+ destinations worldwide and recommend the best matches for you in seconds.

##  What It Does

- **Smart Recommendations**: ML algorithms score destinations based on cost (50%), safety (30%), and weather (20%)
- **Real-Time Data**: Live flight prices, hotel availability, weather forecasts, and safety ratings
- **Budget-Aware**: Automatically filters destinations that fit your budget
- **Instant Results**: Processes 100+ API calls in 2-5 seconds
- **Detailed Insights**: View flights, hotels, cost breakdowns, and ML scoring for each destination

##  Tech Stack

**Backend**: Python, Flask, scikit-learn (Random Forest, Linear Regression)  
**Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS  
**APIs**: Amadeus (flights), Booking.com (hotels), OpenWeather, Travel Advisory, ExchangeRate  
**ML Models**: Hybrid prediction system combining static Numbeo data with ML

##  Project Scope

This system covers:
-  250+ global destinations across 6 continents
-  Multi-factor ranking with machine learning
-  Real-time flight and hotel pricing
-  Budget optimization and filtering
-  Weather and safety analysis

**Current Limitations**:
- Demo uses Amadeus test environment (limited flight data)
